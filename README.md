# Improving Fashion Business with clothes segmentation

The main goal of this project is to train a neural network for clothes segmentation and generate insights to help the fashion industry/stores.

## Possible insights/problems to solve

"Imagine you are searching for a pair of tapered dark wash jeans. By page five, you have seen tapered jeans and you have seen dark wash jeans. Yet, no sign of what you are actually looking for. At this point, you are likely to give up and look elsewhere. In other words, the retailer’s horror story: Site abandonment."

Benefits:

- Improve product discoverability for customers and styling teams/salers
- Group and manage your entire inventory for different customer segments, customer tiers and geographical locations by using regional and segment-specific product tags
- Recommendation, use your product tags to identify and understand each customer’s individual taste and style
- Generate more features to improve the power of machine learning to identify and understand past performance per product and per attribute
- When products in a shop the look recommendation goes out of stock, the A.I. will automatically replace them with the closest visually similar item from in-stock inventory that shares those attribute values
